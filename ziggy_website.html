	<p>	After releasing a pair of mixtapes in 2015, including a collaboration with Future, Drake followed with his fourth studio album, Views, in the spring of 2016.Drake album was an instant sucess. Drake also made the tops of the billboard charts. Also Among its hit singles was the sultry "hotline Bling" which earned the artist grammy wins for the best rap song. one other song that drake made in 2013 called "Started from the bottom " had over a million veiw which was one of his best songs.<br>
		The reason why drake is so successful is  because he releases all his song early, he also got signed to young money entertainment and thereafter getting a huge push from lil wayne, because most of the thing that drake they lil wayne experience and give hime a huge advice.<br>
			Reasons why he the best artists, first thing is he does every thing, he dances, he sings , he rap. One other thing is all of is song are hit which also make him a good artist. Also recently in 2016 or 2017 drake won a battle against meek mill.<br>
			Drake became the first ever artist to log eight straight years on the Hot 100 in May 2017. Also when "Best I Ever Had" was made  in 2009, it marked the beginning of his 431 consecutive week run on the Billboard Hot 100. It wasn't until August 2017 that drake record streak came to an end and he was absent from the Hot 100 for the first time ever.<br>
			As  many people remember the infamous fight between Chris Brown and Drake at the  nightclub, not as many people remember the reason for the fight. It's embarrassing,the amount of media coverage,Also the daly new that that 2 men was fighting over a women.<br>
			Also one of drake biggest songs right now are God plan which was made in 2018, the amount of money that was spent on a video was almost a million dollor from the label.Also drake began his musical journey with a number of self-released mixtapes. As he gained popularity, he released an EP titled 'So Far Gone'. He later went on to release four studio albums, 'Thank Me Later', 'Take Care', 'Nothing Was the Same' and 'Views'. His songs are marked by his egotistical lyrics, often dealing with his personal experiences and relationships with women. Drake, who had a different childhood than most other rappers of African-American origin, feels irritated at the notion that growing up in a neighborhood with guns and drugs makes his peers more "official".<br>
